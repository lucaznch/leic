# IST "Event Management System" (IST-EMS)

### The objective of this project is to develop IST-EMS, an event management system that allows the creation, booking and checking of availability of tickets for events, such as concerts and theater shows.

IST-EMS explores parallelization techniques based on multiple processes and multiple tasks in order to speed up order processing.

When developing IST-SEM, students will also learn how to implement scalable synchronization mechanisms between tasks as well as communication mechanisms between processes (FIFOs and signals).

IST-EMS will also interact with the file system therefore offering the possibility of learning to use POSIX file system programming interfaces.
